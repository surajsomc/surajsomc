### Suraj Somarajan ðŸ‘¾

Passionate problem solver with a strong interest in computer science. I have been fascinated by how computers can be used to solve real-world problems since I was a child.
I am driven by the creativity and problem-solving challenges of the field, the ever-changing landscape of computer science, and the potential to make a real impact on the world.

In college, I have had the opportunity to learn about and apply computer science techniques to a variety of projects, ranging from developing innovative software applications
to tackling complex algorithmic puzzles. Throughout my academic journey, I've embraced the chance to collaborate with like-minded peers, pushing the boundaries of what we can achieve together.

Ultimately, my goal is to leverage my skills and enthusiasm to tackle complex challenges, drive innovation, and make a positive impact.
Whether it's refining existing systems for efficiency, developing new tools that simplify tasks, or delving into uncharted territories,
I am ready to contribute my creativity, critical thinking, and passion for computer science to shape a better future for all.
